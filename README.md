# Compiler_from_Java_to_MIPS

Link to the project's description: https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~lesani/teaching/cp/cp.html

## Phase 1: Type-Checking
Wrting a type-checker for MiniJava that checks for the type mismatches at compiling time.

## Phase 2: Intermediate Code Generation for Object-oriented Languages
Translating the MiniJava language to Vapor language which is a low level assembly language that includes a set of functions and data segments. 

## Phase 3: Register Allocation
Translating Vapor language to the Vapor-M language which represents registers and stacks

## Phase 4: Activation Records and Instruction Selection
Mapping the Vapor-M registers and stacks to to MIPS registers and runtime stack.
